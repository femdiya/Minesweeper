# mnpl.ir â€“ Minesweeper Project

Welcome to **mnpl.ir**, a minimalist HTML-based Minesweeper game made for fun and learning.

This project is a simple browser-based version of the classic **Minesweeper** game. It's built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external dependencies. (Well, except for the Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts)
